    "_Refer to Exercise 5.10 of the Newman text._ Consider an anharmonic oscillator with potential $V(x)$ symmetric about $x = 0$. Let us set our anharmonic oscillator going with amplitude $a$. That is, at $t = 0$ we release it from rest at position $x = a$ and it swings back towards the origin. Then at $t = 0$ we have $dx/dt = 0$ and the equation for its total energy becomes $E = V(a)$, i.e., the total energy of the particle is given in terms of the amplitude.\n",
